# Choose Boring Technology - Mini Summary

Dan McKinley's article emphasizes the importance of choosing "boring" technologies in software development. This minimizes risks and operational costs. Companies have limited "innovation tokens" to spend on new technologies, and it's crucial to use them wisely.

While new technologies may seem appealing, they often come with unknown problems and increased operational complexity. Experienced developers understand that the long-term costs of maintaining a reliable system outweigh the short-term benefits of using the latest tools.

The article advocates a thoughtful approach to technology adoption, where new technologies are carefully evaluated for their impact on the entire organization and system. It recommends a process for examining new technologies, including assessing whether the problem can be solved with existing tools and setting clear expectations for migrating old functionality.
