# WTF Notebook

**Objective:** To document instances that elicit a "WTF" reaction and identified improvement tasks.

**Instructions:**

* **WTF:** Note down every instance where you encounter something unexpected, illogical, or confusing.
* **Task:** Record every idea for a change or improvement you want to implement.

**Tracking and Resolution:**

After some time, begin crossing out lines based on the following reasons:

**Reasons for crossing out a line:**

1.  There is actually a good reason for it.
2.  The team is already working on a fix.
3.  The team doesn't consider it a priority.
4.  It's relatively easy to fix.

Then, start to analyze why some lines **remain**.

**Reasons for a line to remain uncrossed:**

1.  The team hasn't noticed it yet.
2.  The team has gotten used to it.
3.  The problem is relatively new, and the old problem it replaced was much worse.
4.  They don't know how to fix the problem.
5.  They've tried to fix the problem before and failed.
